The goal of rGeopoll is to carry out descriptive analysis at Geopoll

## Installation

You can install the released version of rGeopoll from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rGeopoll")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Shelmith-Kariuki/rGeopoll")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(rGeopoll)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
## Coming Soon
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date.

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub\!
